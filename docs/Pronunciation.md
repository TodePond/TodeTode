## Sounds

If you're a human, you probably make it hard to make tode noises.

Instead, you can use these similar sounds instead.<br>
There are two choices for each sound. Say whatever flows easiest in the sentence.

The following audio shows how to pronounce each one. It reads them from top-left, to bottom-right. Note: Pronunciation is not strict.

## Order

Read from:
* outside-in
* bottom-to-top

As an example, let's take the word for 'don't like':

It's `wind (rain (bot (tode))) fire`.<br>
Or in other words, `woo lo da ra cur`.
You could shorten this. All of these are valid as well:
* `woolodarac`
* `woolarac`

Consider using the longer version if you want to emphasise the word, or in a more formal setting. Use the shorter one if it doesn't matter so much, or you're in a rush.

Combined with some other words, you could say `ruruh woolarac dat`.<br>
This means "I don't like robots".
